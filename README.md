*For brevity, let's call unmanaged dependencies udeps.*

# Creating a template for .NET/native interop

vNext reduces reliance (and eventually, access) to OS APIs. To replace that functionality (or to be cross-platform), we must turn to open-source C and C++ libraries.

## Challenges

1. Exploits are more common in native code. Low-friction upstream merges, builds, tests, and static analysis are key to maintaining security. Burden of security responsibility always falls on the wrapper maintainer (at least, in the Win ecosystem).
2. Visual Studio does not track or copy udeps.
3. Udeps are not shadow-copied. Resulting issues include (but are not limited to) frequent deploy failures due to locked files.
4. Not all udeps are assemblies (unmanaged assemblies often depend on physical .xml or data files which can't be embedded).
5. No API to discover 'original' location. Compilation folder - .CodePoint check. Shadow-copied .Location - check. Directory assemblies were shadow-copied from? We can make educated (but often incorrect) guesses. 
6. NuGet is blind to udeps. Scripted solutions still break in some scenarios.
7. MinGW (the most common cross-platform build environment) is poorly maintained and very underfunded. 
8. Cmake on windows can be painful.
9. No compatibility between VS and GNU build toolchains. 
10. Interop can be impossible with more than one AppDomain per process. (If dll has any static configuration, or lacks its own thread safety). Looking at you, OpenCV.
11. No safe/reliable lifecycle events to hook into and fixup DLL loading/copying and unloading (AFAIK). Mutexes in App_Start, perhaps? Failure would be permanent.
12. Binding generation is still stupidly difficult. CppSharp is very promising; provides the smartest bindings I've seen to date. Unfortunately, it has minimal documentation, and could use assistance from native english speakers.


## Known workarounds

2) Visual Studio ignores native assemblies.

---

Define subfolders in your project for each architecture, with all dependencies in each.

Use LoadLibraryEx to manually load the .dlls depending upon executing architecture. 

**Failures: Challenge 5 makes this imprecise. Makes versioning issues commonplace. Does not work for child dependencies - every project must subsume these CopyFile references to work. Messy**

---

Host copies of udeps on a secure server with HTTPS support. During Application_Start, download the correct dependencies to /bin. **Fails with file locking errors with multiple worker processes - or AppDomains- or recycling.**

---

Embed copies of native dependencies in the managed DLLs, then extract them at runtime. 

**Failures: Very slow. Horrible bloating. Fails with file locking errors with multiple worker processes or AppDomains unless a new copy is created for each AppDomain.**


## End goals

Create a sample cross-platform, multi-architecture NuGet package with udeps - that *just works* in ASP.NET and ASP.NET vNext - even when you switch between 32 and 64-bit test runners. All processes (builds, tests, static analysis, binding generation) must be scripted and AppVeyor compatible.

To cover all bases, it should include indirect udeps and udeps with procwide configuration (like a callback fn).

This includes

* Scripted unmanaged builds from source (with dependencies). Both MinGW (make and cmake) and MSVC approaches should be shown.
* AppVeyor compatible build scripts, unit tests (managed and unmanaged), and static analysis.
* Scripted binding or P/Invoke generation that works well (probably CppSharp).
* A safe & reliable DLL fixup approach that works in all conditions (VS, Test runners, Azure, and IIS)
* Preventing multiple AppDomains per process (optionally).
* Automated nuget publishing (triggered by tags, perhaps?) via AppVeyor

Solid workarounds are fine - but what can't be worked around needs to be fixed in tooling. 


## Prerequisite goals

Define standards for

* Describing udeps for a managed assembly (either through attributes or embedded manifests). In some scenarios this list could be inferred from the P/Invoke metadata, if combined with conventions, and when there are no indirect dependencies.

* Conventions for organization of udeps by architecture and possibly by locale? More than one architecture may need to be deployed or tested, so all variants must be reachable.
